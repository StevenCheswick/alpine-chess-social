### Damiano's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Pawn (or Bishop)
- **Description**: A queen delivers checkmate through the 7th rank against a castled king while being protected by a pawn (typically on g6 or f7) or a bishop. The king's pawn shield is compromised, leaving no escape.

- **Memory Hook**: "The Face Kiss" - the queen delivers mate right in front of the king.

### Damiano's Bishop Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Bishop
- **Description**: A variation where the queen and bishop cooperate - the queen checks and the bishop defends the queen from a distance.
- **Origin**: Also attributed to Pedro Damiano's 1512 work.

### Greco's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Bishop
- **Description**: The enemy king is trapped on the edge of the board (typically h8). The bishop controls one escape square (g8) while another is blocked by the king's own pieces. The rook delivers the final blow on the h-file.

- **Origin**: Named after Max Lange, a German chess player and author from the 19th century.

### Mayet's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Bishop
- **Description**: A rook is placed right next to the enemy king while being supported by a bishop on a long diagonal against a castled king. Similar to Opera Mate but occurs from a different direction (typically on h7 or a2).
- **Origin**: Named after Karl Mayet, a German chess player from the 19th century. A notable example occurred in Pillsbury-Lee, 1899.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Fianchetto Killer"

### Morphy's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop + Rook
- **Description**: The king is trapped in the corner by its own pawn and a rook cutting off escape squares. The bishop delivers mate from a distance on a diagonal.
- **Origin**: Named after Paul Morphy, the legendary American chess prodigy from the 1850s-60s.

### Pillsbury's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Bishop
- **Description**: Nearly identical to Morphy's Mate - the bishop controls the corner square next to a castled king while the rook delivers checkmate on an open file. The pawn shield must be compromised for this to work.
- **Origin**: Named after Harry Nelson Pillsbury, one of the strongest American players of the late 19th century.

### Réti's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop (+ Rook/Queen support)
- **Description**: The enemy king is trapped by four of its own pieces. A bishop delivers the final blow from a distance, using its x-ray ability to cover multiple escape squares simultaneously. A rook or queen supports the bishop.
- **Origin**: Named after Richard Réti, who delivered this checkmate in an 11-move game against Savielly Tartakower in Vienna, 1910.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Self-Block" - the enemy king's own pieces trap it.

### Stamma's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Knight (+ King)
- **Description**: A rare endgame pattern where a player forces checkmate with only a king and knight, due to the opponent's king being trapped in front of an advanced rook's pawn. The attacking player's king confines the enemy king, and the knight delivers mate.
- **Origin**: Named after Philipp Stamma, a Syrian chess master and author from the 18th century.

### Vukovic's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Knight (+ Pawn/supporting piece)
- **Description**: A complex edge mate where a protected rook delivers checkmate to the king at the edge of the board, while a knight covers the remaining escape squares. The knight, rook, and king are typically aligned in a row.
- **Origin**: Named after Vladimir Vukovic (1898-1975), Croatian International Master who documented this pattern in his book *The Art of Attack in Chess*.

### Philidor's Legacy
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Knight
- **Description**: A specific forced sequence ending in smothered mate: Knight check forcing the king out of the corner, knight moves to deliver discovered double check from queen and knight, queen sacrifice to force the rook next to the king, then knight delivers smothered mate.
- **Origin**: Named after François-André Danican Philidor, though it was described earlier in Luis Ramirez Lucena's 1497 text *Repetición de Amores e Arte de Axedrez*.
- **Also Known As**: Philidor's Mate

## Descriptive/Positional Patterns

### Arabian Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Knight + Rook
- **Description**: The oldest documented checkmate pattern. A knight and rook coordinate to trap the king in a corner. The rook sits adjacent to the king (delivering check), and the knight sits two squares away diagonally, protecting the rook and covering escape squares.
- **Origin**: Mentioned in an ancient Arabic manuscript dating from the 8th century CE. Derived from an older form of chess where the knight and rook were the two most powerful pieces.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Hug" - the pieces embrace the king in the corner.

### Back Rank Mate

- **Memory Hook**: "The Corridor" - the king is trapped in a corridor of its own making.

### Balestra Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Bishop
- **Description**: The bishop checks the king on the side of the board while the queen blocks escape squares (without giving check itself). The final position resembles a pair of scissors.
- **Origin**: The name "Balestra" was first used as a tag on chesstempo.com to distinguish it from Boden's Mate (which uses two bishops).
- **Memory Hook**: "The Scissors"

### Blind Swine Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Two Rooks
- **Description**: Two rooks on the 7th rank coordinate to deliver checkmate to a castled king trapped in the corner.
- **Origin**: The name is attributed to Polish master Dawid Janowski, who referred to doubled rooks on a player's 7th rank as "swine" (or "pigs").
- **Memory Hook**: "Pigs on the 7th"

### Box Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Queen (or King)
- **Description**: A 3x3 box-shaped checkmate where the king is locked in a confined area by a rook and queen working together. The rook is adjacent to the king, and the queen one square away.
- **Also Known As**: Kill Box Mate
- **Memory Hook**: "The 3x3 Prison"

### Bucking Bronco Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Knight
- **Description**: A Queen-Knight combination where the enemy king is trapped in the corner of the board. The queen controls all escape squares while the knight delivers checkmate.
- **Origin**: A modern naming convention for this Queen-Knight pattern, which was underrepresented in classical chess literature.

### Collaboration Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop + Knight
- **Description**: The bishop delivers checkmate while the knight controls the escape squares. This is the reverse of the Suffocation Mate (where the knight mates and the bishop controls squares).

### Corner Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Knight
- **Description**: A checkmate against an enemy king trapped in a corner. The rook cuts off escape squares on a file or rank while the knight delivers the final attack.

### Corridor Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Various (Rook, Queen, or Bishop)
- **Description**: A general category where the enemy king cannot escape from check because it's trapped along a rank, file, or diagonal (a "corridor"). The Back Rank Mate is a specific type of corridor mate.

### Diagonal Corridor Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop
- **Description**: A lone bishop traps the enemy king on a long diagonal (e.g., h8 or a1), delivering checkmate. The king's escape is blocked by its own pieces.

### David and Goliath Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Pawn (+ supporting pieces)
- **Description**: A rare and satisfying pattern where a humble pawn delivers the final checkmate. The enemy king's escape squares are controlled or blocked by its own pieces.
- **Also Known As**: Pawn Mate
- **Memory Hook**: "The Little Guy Wins"

### Double Bishop Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Two Bishops
- **Description**: Similar to Boden's Mate, but the two bishops are placed on parallel diagonals (rather than criss-crossing). They work together to control escape squares and force the king to the edge.

### Double Knight Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Two Knights
- **Description**: Two knights coordinate to finish the game. Usually involves a king trapped behind pawns and blocked by a piece to the side. One knight checks, forcing the king into position to be checkmated by the other knight.
- **Note**: This is different from the Two Knights vs King endgame (see Basic Endgame Checkmates).

### Dovetail Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen (+ supporting piece)
- **Description**: The queen checks the king diagonally (contact check) while the king's retreat squares are blocked by its own pieces, forming a pattern that visually resembles a dove's tail.
- **Also Known As**: Cozio's Mate

### Epaulette Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen (+ opponent's pieces blocking)
- **Description**: The king is on its back rank, sandwiched between its own two pieces (typically rooks) which block the side squares like ornamental shoulder pieces (epaulettes) worn on military uniforms. A queen checks from directly in front.
- **Notable Game**: Magnus Carlsen, aged thirteen, achieved an unusual "sideways" epaulette mate against Ernst at Wijk aan Zee (Corus) 2004.

### Guéridon Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen (+ supporting piece)
- **Description**: The queen checks the king directly (contact check) while supported by another piece. The king cannot retreat diagonally because its own pieces block it in a V-shape.
- **Also Known As**: Swallow's Tail Mate
- **Memory Hook**: Named after the French word for "pedestal table"

### H-file Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Bishop
- **Description**: A rook delivers checkmate along an open h-file against a castled king. The rook is typically protected by a bishop on the long diagonal.

### Hook Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Knight + Pawn
- **Description**: A chain of protection forms a hook shape: the rook delivers checkmate, protected by the knight, which is protected by a pawn. A friendly pawn also blocks the king's only flight square.

### Lawnmower Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Two Rooks (or Rook + Queen)
- **Description**: One of the most straightforward mating patterns. Two major pieces work together to push the enemy king toward the edge of the board, cutting off one rank or file at a time like a lawnmower cutting grass.
- **Also Known As**: Ladder Mate, Rook Rolling, Rook Roller, Staircase Mate, Escalator Mate, Two Rooks Checkmate
- **Memory Hook**: "Step by Step"

### Opera Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Bishop
- **Description**: A rook delivers checkmate on the back rank while being protected by a bishop on a long diagonal. The enemy king is confined by its own pieces.
- **Origin**: Named after Paul Morphy's famous game played at the Paris Opera in 1858 against Duke Karl of Brunswick and Count Isouard.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Masked Bishop" - the bishop supports from behind.

### Railroad Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Rook
- **Description**: Combines features of the Triangle Mate and Kill Box Mate. Demonstrates powerful coordination between a queen and rook moving relentlessly toward the enemy king.
- **Memory Hook**: Moving like an "unstoppable train"

### Smothered Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Knight
- **Description**: Widely considered the most beautiful checkmate in chess. A lone knight delivers checkmate to a king that is completely surrounded ("smothered") by its own pieces, leaving no escape squares. Only the knight can deliver this mate because it's the only piece that can jump over other pieces.
- **Memory Hook**: "Friendly Fire" - the king's own pieces cause its demise.

### Sneaky Stallion Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Knight
- **Description**: Similar to Bucking Bronco Mate, but the enemy king is on the edge of the board (rather than in the corner), with its escape square blocked by one of its own pieces.
- **Origin**: A modern naming convention for this Queen-Knight pattern.

### Suffocation Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop + Knight
- **Description**: The bishop "suffocates" the king by controlling flight squares from a distance, pinning down the king's mobility. The knight delivers the final checkmate.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Bishop Glue"

### Swallow's Tail Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen (+ supporting piece)
- **Description**: The queen checks the king right in front (supported by another piece). The king cannot retreat because its own pieces block it in a V-shape, resembling the tail of a swallow.
- **Also Known As**: Guéridon Mate

### Triangle Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Rook
- **Description**: The queen checkmates the king on the edge of the board, supported by a rook two squares away on the same file or rank. The queen, rook, and king form a triangular shape.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Geometry"

### Bombardier's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Two Bishops
- **Description**: Two bishops "bombard" down diagonals toward the enemy king. One bishop delivers mate while the other controls escape squares.

### Minor Piece Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop and/or Knight(s)
- **Description**: A general category for checkmates delivered primarily by minor pieces (bishops and knights). Often follows queen sacrifices and forcing checks, with a knight typically delivering the final blow.
- **Examples**: Légal's Mate, Blackburne's Mate, Suffocation Mate, Collaboration Mate

### Battery Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Bishop (or Rook + Queen on same line)
- **Description**: A checkmate delivered using a "battery" formation where two pieces are aligned on the same rank, file, or diagonal. One piece delivers the checkmate while the other supports it from behind.
- **Common Formation**: Queen-Bishop battery on a diagonal is one of the most integral checkmating patterns.

### Contact Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Various
- **Description**: A checkmate where the piece delivering mate is adjacent to (in "contact" with) the enemy king. Examples include many back rank mates, smothered mates, and queen mates where the queen is next to the king.
- **Contrast**: Opposite of "long-range" mates delivered by pieces at a distance.

## Basic Endgame Checkmates

These are fundamental mating techniques with minimal material.

### Queen Mate (Basic Endgame)
- **Pieces Required**: King + Queen vs. King
- **Description**: The queen works with her king against the enemy king, forcing it to the edge or corner of the board and eventually into zugzwang (forced to make a losing move). This is one of the easiest basic checkmates to learn.
- **Memory Hook**: "The Box Closes"

### Rook Mate (Basic Endgame)
- **Pieces Required**: King + Rook vs. King
- **Description**: The rook cuts off ranks or files, progressively shrinking the available space until the enemy king is forced to the edge of the board where it can be mated.
- **Also Known As**: Box Mate (when forcing the king step by step)
- **Memory Hook**: "The Shrinking Box"

### Two Bishops Mate (Basic Endgame)
- **Pieces Required**: King + Two Bishops vs. King
- **Description**: One of the four basic checkmates. The bishop pair efficiently creates barriers the enemy king cannot cross. The two bishops work together to control light and dark squares, forcing the enemy king to a corner where checkmate is delivered.

### Bishop and Knight Mate (Basic Endgame)
- **Pieces Required**: King + Bishop + Knight vs. King
- **Description**: The most difficult of the four basic checkmates to execute. The enemy king must be forced into a corner that matches the bishop's color (same color squares). Can require up to 34 moves if both sides play perfectly.
- **Memory Hook**: "The W Maneuver" - a technique to drive the king to the correct corner.

### Two Knights Mate
- **Pieces Required**: King + Two Knights vs. King (+ Pawn)
- **Description**: A paradoxical situation: two knights cannot force checkmate against a bare king (only stalemate), but CAN force mate if the opponent has a pawn! The pawn gives the defender a move, preventing stalemate. This is one of the most difficult endgames in chess.
- **Key Concept**: The Troitsky Line determines when the position is winning.
- **Note**: This endgame is so difficult that even grandmasters have failed to convert winning positions.

## Quick Opening Checkmates

These patterns occur early in the game, often from opening blunders.

### Fool's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen
- **Description**: The fastest possible checkmate in chess, achieved in only two moves (by Black). White must weaken the e1-h4 diagonal by moving both the f-pawn and g-pawn, allowing Black's queen to deliver checkmate on h4.
- **Example**: 1.f3 e6 2.g4 Qh4#
- **Origin**: Named and described in *The Royal Game of Chess-Play* (1656) by Francis Beale, adapted from Gioachino Greco's work.
- **Note**: Can only be achieved by Black. A similar mate by White requires three moves.

### Scholar's Mate
- **Pieces Required**: Queen + Bishop
- **Description**: A very common four-move checkmate among beginners. The queen and bishop coordinate to attack the f7 square (or f2 for Black), which is only defended by the king at the game's start.
- **Example**: 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6?? 4.Qxf7#
- **Also Known As**: Four-Move Checkmate

---

## Special Move Checkmates

These patterns involve special chess moves delivering or enabling checkmate.

### En Passant Checkmate
- **Pieces Required**: Pawn (capturing en passant)
- **Description**: An extremely rare checkmate where the en passant capture delivers or enables checkmate. The capturing pawn removes a defender or opens a line, resulting in checkmate.
- **Rarity**: One of the rarest checkmate types in practical play.

### Castling Checkmate (Short Castling)
- **Pieces Required**: King + Rook (kingside castling)
- **Description**: A checkmate delivered by the rook's movement during kingside castling (O-O). As the king moves from e1 to g1 (or e8 to g8), the rook swings from h1 to f1 (or h8 to f8), delivering checkmate.
- **Rarity**: Extremely rare in practical play.

### Castling Checkmate (Long Castling)
- **Pieces Required**: King + Rook (queenside castling)
- **Description**: A checkmate delivered by the rook's movement during queenside castling (O-O-O). The rook moves from a1 to d1 (or a8 to d8), delivering checkmate.
- **Rarity**: Even rarer than short castling checkmate.

### Discovered Checkmate
- **Pieces Required**: Any two pieces (one moves, one delivers check)
- **Description**: A checkmate delivered via discovered attack. One piece moves out of the way, revealing an attack from a piece behind it that delivers checkmate. The moving piece may also contribute to the mate.
- **Note**: This is a mechanism rather than a specific position, but documented as a distinct checkmate type.

### Double Checkmate
- **Pieces Required**: Two pieces giving check simultaneously
- **Description**: A checkmate where two pieces deliver check at the same time (discovered check plus the moving piece's check). Since both pieces give check, the only legal response would be moving the king, but if no escape exists, it's checkmate.
- **Note**: Particularly powerful because blocking or capturing is impossible.

### Promotion Checkmate
- **Pieces Required**: Pawn (promoting)
- **Description**: A checkmate delivered on the same move as pawn promotion. The pawn reaches the eighth rank, promotes (usually to queen), and delivers checkmate simultaneously.
- **Variation**: An underpromotion checkmate occurs when promoting to a knight, bishop, or rook delivers mate (knight underpromotion is most common for this).

## Attacking Patterns Leading to Mate

These are famous attacking patterns that typically lead to checkmate sequences.

### Greek Gift Sacrifice
- **Pieces Required**: Bishop + Knight + Queen
- **Description**: One of the most famous attacking patterns in chess. A bishop sacrifice on h7 (Bxh7+ against Black) or h2 (Bxh2+ against White) exposes the castled king. After Kxh7, Ng5+ follows, then Qh5 or similar, leading to checkmate or winning material.
- **Prerequisites**: The opponent has castled kingside; the f6/f3 square is not defended by a knight; the attacker's knight can reach g5/g4; the queen can reach the h-file.
- **Origin**: Named after the Trojan Horse story ("Beware Greeks bearing gifts"). Also attributed to Gioachino Greco's games.
- **Also Known As**: Classical Bishop Sacrifice, Bxh7+ Sacrifice

### Double Bishop Sacrifice
- **Pieces Required**: Two Bishops + Queen
- **Description**: An extension of the Greek Gift where both bishops are sacrificed. After Bxh7+ Kxh7, the second bishop is sacrificed on g7 (Bxg7+ Kxg7), completely destroying the king's pawn cover and leading to a devastating attack.
- **Origin**: Made famous by Emanuel Lasker's game against Johann Bauer in Amsterdam, 1889.
- **Also Known As**: Lasker Sacrifice
- **Notable Games**: Lasker-Bauer 1889, Nimzowitsch-Tarrasch 1914, Polgar-Karpov 2003

### Windmill
- **Pieces Required**: Rook + Bishop (typically)
- **Description**: A tactical pattern involving alternating discovered checks. A piece (usually a rook) delivers checks while a bishop (or other piece) gives discovered checks. The opponent's king is forced back and forth like a windmill, allowing the attacker to capture multiple pieces.
- **Famous Example**: Torre-Lasker, Moscow 1925
- **Also Known As**: Seesaw

## Chess Problem/Composition Terms

These terms are used primarily in chess problem composition but describe specific checkmate qualities.

### Pure Mate
- **Description**: A checkmate position where each of the squares in the king's field is guarded, attacked, or blocked in exactly one way. The king is attacked exactly once. Each square has exactly one reason why the king cannot escape to it.
- **Aesthetic Value**: Highly prized in chess problems for their elegance.
- **Context**: Primarily of interest to chess problem composers; occurrence in practical play is incidental.

### Economical Mate
- **Description**: A checkmate where all of the attacking side's pieces (with the possible exception of king and pawns) participate in delivering or supporting the mate.
- **Context**: Demonstrates efficient piece coordination.

### Model Mate
- **Description**: A checkmate that is both "pure" AND "economical." The checkmated king and all vacant squares in its field are attacked only once; squares occupied by friendly units are not also attacked by the mating side; all units of the mating side participate actively.
- **Rarity**: Extremely rare in practical play; forms the basis of the Bohemian school of chess composition.
- **Context**: Considered the most artistic form of checkmate in chess problems.

### Ideal Mate
- **Description**: A pure mate where ALL material on the board (of either color) plays a direct role in the checkmate. Every single piece contributes to the final position.
- **Rarity**: The rarest and most prized form of checkmate in chess composition.
