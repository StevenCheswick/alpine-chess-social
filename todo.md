## Costliest Opening Habits
- [ ] Filter out known opening theory from results — currently established lines like the Evans Gambit show up as "blunders" because they lose some eval, but they're legitimate theory moves, not repeated mistakes

## Endgame Type Detection
- [ ] Detect and tag common endgame types during analysis:
  - KP vs K (King + Pawn vs King)
  - Lucena position
  - Philidor position
  - KBN vs K (Knight and Bishop mate)
  - Basic rook endgames (rook + pawn vs rook)
  - Queen vs Rook
  - Opposite-color bishop endgames
